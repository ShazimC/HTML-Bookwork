		<h1>Using Internal CSS</h1>

		<p>
			You can also include CSS rules within an HTML page by placing them inside a style element, which usually sits inside the head element of the page. <br>
			<b>style element:</b> should use the type attribute to indicate that the styles are specified in CSS. The value should be text/css.
			<b>NOTE:</b> when building a site with more than one page, you should use an external CSS style sheet. This:
			<ul>
				<li>Allows all pages to use the same style rules (rather than repeating them each page.</li>
				<li>Keeps the content seperate from how the page looks.</li>
				<li>Means you can change the styles used across all pages by altering just one file (rather than each individual page).</li>
			</ul>
