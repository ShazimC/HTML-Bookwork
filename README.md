# HTML-Bookwork
My bookwork from Jon Duckett's "HTML and CSS - Design and Build Websites". Developed proficiency in HTML and CSS through utilizing my time and this book during summer 2018. Currently building a portfolio website using my developed skills from this book. Great book by the way. A very helpful guide for someone new to web development.
