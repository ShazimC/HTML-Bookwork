/* 
    ? Regexp Golf
    - is the prattice of writing the smallest possible reuglar expression 
        for a given pattern and ONLY that pattern.
    - write one out testing whether ONLY the given substrings occur in any
        input string: see list on pg 164.
*/

/* 
    ? Quoting Style
    - you want to replace all the single quotes used for distinguishing
        dialogue like: he said, '...' with double quotes.
    - this should not include apostrophes from words like aren't, didn't etc.
    - accomplish this using regular expresssions and the replace method.
*/

/* 
    ? Numbers Again
    - Write a regexp that recognizes JS style numbers including:
        - optional minus/plus sign in beginning
        - the decimal dot, but the dot alone is invalid
        - exponent notation: 5e-3 or 1e10
