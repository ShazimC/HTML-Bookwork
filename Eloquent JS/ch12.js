/* 
    * Parsing
    - The most immediately visible part of a programming
    language is the syntax.
    * Parser - a program that reads a piece of text and produces
    * a data structure that reflects the structure of the program
    * contained in that text.
        - if the text does not form a valid program, the parser
        should point out the error.
