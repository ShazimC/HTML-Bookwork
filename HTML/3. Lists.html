		<h2>Ordered Lists</h2>
			<p>The ordered list is created with the ol element.</p>
			<p>Each item in the list is placed between li tags.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Chop potatoes into quarters.</li>
				<li>Simmer in salted water for 20-30 minutes until tender.</li>
				<li>Heat milk, butter and nutmeg.</li>
			</ol>
		
		<h2>Unordered lists</h2>
			<p>The unordered list is created with the ul element.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>First let me hop.</li>
				<li>Out the muhheckin porsche.</li>
				<li>Iowanna hit them textbooks.</li>
				<li>So that I can become smarter respectively.</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Definition Lists</h2>
			<p>The definition list is created with the dl (definition list) element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions. Inside the dl elements you will usually see pairs of dt and dd elements.</p>

			<p> <dfn>dt</dfn>: definition term, is used to contain the term being defined.</p>
			<p> <dfn>dd</dfn>: definition definition is used to contain the definition.</p>

			<dl>
				<dt>Sashimi</dt>
				<dd>Sliced raw fish that is served with condiments such as shreded daikon radish or ginger root, wasabi and soy sauce.</dd>

				<dt>Scale</dt>
				<dd>A device used to accurately measure the weight of ingredients.</dd>
				<dd>A technique by which the scales are removed from the skin of a fish</dd>

				<dt>Scamorzo</dt>
				<dd>An Italian cheese usually made from whole cow's milk (although it was traditionally made from buffalo milk).</dd>
			</dl>

			<h2>Nested Lists</h2>
				<p>You can put a second list inside an li element to create a sub-list/nested list.</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Mice</li>
					<li>Cats</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Lions</li>
							<li>Cheetas</li>
							<li>Jaguars</li>
							<li>House cats</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Dogs</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Example of use of lists:</h2>

			<h1>Building an Arduino LED Dice</h1>
				<p>Here we will tell you how to make an Arduino programmed LED Dice.</p>
				<h2>Equipment needed:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>1 Arduino Uno.</li>
						<li>7 LEDs.</li>
						<li>Pack of Jumper Wires.</li>
						<li>1 Breadboard.</li>
						<li>4 1K ohm Resistors.</li>
						<li>1 10K ohm Resistor.</li>
						<li>Arduino Button.</li>
						<li>Circuit Schematic.</li>
						<li>Arduino Code.</li>
					</ul>

				<h2>Procedure:</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Assemble the 7 LEDs with 3 above, 1 in the middle and 3 below.</li>
						<li>Plug in the 1K resistors into their positive terminals on the breadboard.</li>
						<li>Plug in the button on the breadboard and plug the 10K resistor into its input terminal.</li>
						<li>Now use the jumper wires to connect the button and LEDs to the arduino following the schematic provided.</li>
						<li>Connect the arduino to your computer.</li>
						<li>Download the code provided to the arduino.</li>
						<li>Press the reset button on the arduino.</li>
						<li>Press the button on the breadboard to shuffle the dice and recieve a number between 1 and 6.</li>
						<li>ENJOY!</li>
					</ol>
