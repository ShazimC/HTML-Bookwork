		<h1>Chapter 2: Text</h1>


		<h2>Superscript example</h2>
			<p>...on the 4<sup>th</sup> of July...</p>

		<h2>Subscript example </h2>
			<p>...exhale CO<sub>2</sub> gas...</p>

		<h2>Bold and Italics example</h2>
			<p>I am a <b>BOLD</b> guy, and I don't speak <i>ITALICS</i></p>

		<h2>White Space Collapsing example</h2>
			<p>The moon is drifting away from Earth.</p>
			<p>The moon is               drifting away from Earth.</p>
			<p>The moon is drifting away from
 					Earth.</p>

 		<h2>Line Break example</h2>
			<p>The text will continue after the line break <br /> and here is the text continuing, we can create another break: <br /> and there it is.</p>

		<h2>Horizontal Rule example</h2>
			<p>This is a horizontal rule, it is for breaking themes and creating better structure <hr /> See isn't that nice on the eyes?</p>

		<h2>Strong example</h2>
			<p>used for strong words like <strong>CAUTION</strong> or <strong>ALERT</strong> stuff like <strong>not suitable for children under 5 years old</strong>. By default browsers will show the contents of strong as bolded.</p>

		<h2>Emphasis example</h2>
			<p>indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of the sentence, like I <em>think</em> this is a rock, this sentence hints sarcasm. By defalt browsers will show the contents of emphasis as italicized.</p>

		<h2>Blockquote and q example</h2>
			<p>Blockquote is used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph. Note how the p elemt is still used inside the blockquote element.</p>

			<p>q is used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph, adds quotes usually depending on the browser.</p>

			<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
			Winnie-the-Pooh">
			<p>Did you ever stop to think, and forget to start
			again?</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>As A.A. Milne said, <q>Some people talk to
			animals. Not many listen though. That's the
 			problem.</q></p>

		<h2>Abbreviation and Acronym example</h2>
			<p>You can define an abbreviation for a specific word in the beginning of the paragraph and then when a user hovers over it they can view the full word. Allowing you to use the abbreviation thereafter.</p>

			<p><abbr title = "Professor">Prof</abbr> Stephen Hawking is a theoretical physicist and cosmologist.</p>

			<p>You can define an acronym similarly:</p>

			<p><acronym title = "National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</acronym> do some crazy space stuff</p>

		<h2>Cite example</h2>
			<p>This is used to cite something you are referencing from a book, film, research paper etc.</p>

			<p> <cite>A Brief History of Time</cite> by Stephen Hawking has sold over ten million copies worldwide</p>

		<h2>Definition example</h2>
			<p>A <dfn>black hole</dfn> is a region of space from which nothing, not even light, can escape.</p>

		<h2>Address example</h2>
			<p>The address element has quite a specific use: to contain contact details for the author of the page. It can contain a physical address, but it doesn't have to. For example it may also contain phone number or email.</p>

			<p>Homer Simpson Address: </p>
			<address>
				<p>
					<a href = "mailto:homer@example.org">homer@example.org</a>
				</p>

				<p>742 Evergreen Terrace, Springfield</p>
			</address>

		<h2>Insert, Strike, and Delete Example</h2>
			<p>The insert element can be used to show the content that has been inserted into the document, while the del element can show the text that has been deleted from it.</p>

			<p>It was the <del>worst</del> <ins>best</ins> idea she had ever had.</p>
			
			<p>The s element indicates something that is no longer accurate/relevant but is still important information.</p>

			<p>Laptop Computer: </p>
			<p> <s>Was $995</s></p>
			<p>Now only $450</p>
		

		<h2>Example of text markup using all of the above: </h2>

		<h1>YEET</h1>
			<p>On the 2<sup>nd</sup> of January, it was cold as brick. I could practically see my CO<sub>2</sub> as I exhaled. But I wasn't no <b>WUSSY</b> so I continued to march my way to <i>Dunkin' Donuts</i>.     <br> I arrived at Dunkin' Donuts. Now Imma switch up the theme on yall. <hr> I will now speak formally. <strong>WARNING: if you cannot handle me at my <em>informal</em>, you will not be able to handle me at my <em>formal.</em></strong> Allow me to quote myself from my informal paragraph: <blockquote>..so I continued to march my way to <i>Dunkin' Donuts..</i></blockquote> Notice how I italicized Dunkin' Donuts, this is because Dunkin' Donuts is quite important to me. If you would like to visit the <acronym title = "Dunkin' Donuts">DD</acronym> near me, here is the address:
				<address>
					<p>
						<a href="mailto:dunkin@dunkinDonuts.org">dunkin@dunkinDonuts.org</a>

			I <del>mighta</del> <ins>might have</ins> given away a bit too much information. But here is some more anyway because I really do not give any cares:
			<br>

			Price of two egg & cheese wraps:
			<br>
			<s>$4</s>
